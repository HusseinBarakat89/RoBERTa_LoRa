    "### 1. Model Selection\n",
    "##### 1.1. What are the questions to ask about the model selection:\n",
    "1. Which model to be used?\n",
    "According to papers with code the SOTA on Yelp dataset is a variation of RoBERTa. Therefore RoBERTa is a decent architecture to start with\n",
    "2. fined-tuned of RoBERTa or Agnostic?\n",
    "Since Yelp fine-tuned RoBERTa is not allowed, the two options available to test are Amazon-Polarity fine-tuned RoBERTa and agnostic RoBERTa\n",
    "3. How to select between these two models with no expensive training?\n",
    "Using both Models to generate representations, and Run a decision tree on the top of them as a way to compare the quality of representations\n",
    "4. Why decision Trees?\n",
    "After running a punch of trials, the confusion matrix reflected that the main drop in accuracy takes place due to the confusion between (2, 3) and (1, 2). Therefore, I think that argmax is not the most efficient way to pick up the threshold of classification, and picking up thresholds that reduce entropy is the speciality of decision trees\n",
